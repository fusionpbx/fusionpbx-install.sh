FusionPBX Install
--------------------------------------
A quick install guide for a FusionPBX install. It is recommended to start the install on a minimal install.


### Debian
Debian is the preferred operating system by the FreeSWITCH developers. 
It supports the latest video dependencies. If you want to do video mixing use Debian.

```sh
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fusionpbx/fusionpbx-install.sh/master/debian/pre-install.sh | sh
cd /usr/src/fusionpbx-install.sh/debian && ./install.sh
```
### Devuan
If you like Debian but rather not bother with systemd, Devuan is a "drop in" replacement.
Version 1 is bassed on Jessie. So you will find the same packages available.
Please note that the source installation and installation on ARM is not fully tested.

```sh
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fusionpbx/fusionpbx-install.sh/master/devuan/pre-install.sh | sh
cd /usr/src/fusionpbx-install.sh/devuan && ./install.sh
```

### FreeBSD
FreeBSD is an operating system that has many great features like ZFS, HAST, CARP and more.

```sh
pkg install --yes git
cd /usr/src && git clone https://github.com/fusionpbx/fusionpbx-install.sh.git
cd /usr/src/fusionpbx-install.sh/freebsd/
./install.sh
```

### CentOS
CentOS operating system is a requirement for some companies. Don't expect video mixing to work. It will likely be a year or more for video mixing dependencies to be updated enough to work in CentOS.

```sh
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fusionpbx/fusionpbx-install.sh/master/centos/pre-install.sh | sh
cd /usr/src/fusionpbx-install.sh/centos && ./install.sh
```

### Windows
Don't expect everything to work. Testing is required.
mod_lua is missing from builds after 1.6.14. Script will download it from github.
Open PowerShell as Administrator and run commands

```sh
Set-Location "$env:PUBLIC\Downloads"
Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fusionpbx/fusionpbx-install.sh/master/windows/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1
#run the script
.\install.ps1
```
