# Option:  failregex
# Notes.:  regex to match the password failures messages in the logfile. The
#          host must be matched by a group named "host". The tag "<HOST>" can
#          be used for standard IP/hostname matching and is only an alias for
#          (?:::f{4,6}:)?(?P<host>[\w\-.^_]+)
# Values:  TEXT
#
#failregex = [hostname] FusionPBX: \[<HOST>\] authentication failed
#[hostname] variable doesn't seem to work in every case. Do this instead:
failregex = 404 not found <HOST>
